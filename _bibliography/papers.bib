  abstract  = {This paper settles an open and challenging question pertaining to the design of simple and optimal high-order methods for solving smooth and monotone variational inequalities (VIs). A VI involves finding $z \in X$ such that $\langle F(x), x - z \rangle \geq 0$ for all $x \in X$. We consider the setting in which $F: R^d \rightarrow R^d$ is smooth with up to $(p-1)$-order derivatives. For $p = 2$, the cubic regularization of Newton's method has been extended to VIs with a global rate of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. An improved rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/3}\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ can be obtained via an alternative second-order method, but this method requires a nontrivial line-search procedure as an inner loop. Similarly, the existing high-order methods based on line-search procedures have been shown to achieve a rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)}\log\log(1/\epsilon))$. As emphasized by Y. Nesterov, however, such procedures do not necessarily imply the practical applicability in large-scale applications, and it is desirable to complement these results with a simple high-order VI method that retains the optimality of the more complex methods. We propose a $p$-order method that does \textit{not} require any line search procedure and provably converges to a weak solution at a rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)})$. We prove that our $p$-order method is optimal in the monotone setting by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)})$ under a generalized linear span assumption. A restarted version of our $p$-order method attains a linear rate for smooth and $p$-order uniformly monotone VIs and another restarted version of our $p$-order method attains a local superlinear rate for smooth and strongly monotone VIs. Further, the similar $p$-order method achieves a global rate of $O(\epsilon^{-2/p})$ for solving smooth and nonmonotone VIs satisfying the Minty condition. Two restarted versions attain a global linear rate under additional $p$-order uniform Minty condition and a local superlinear rate under additional strong Minty condition.},
